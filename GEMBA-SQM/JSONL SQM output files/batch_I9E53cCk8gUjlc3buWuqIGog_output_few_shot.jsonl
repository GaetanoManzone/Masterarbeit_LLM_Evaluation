Also, the phrase \"einer harten Kernkapitalquote von circa 13 %\" in the human reference adds a nuance (\"einer harten\") that specifies the nature of the capital ratio mentioned, not just any capital ratio but specifically a \"tough core capital quota\". This nuance was not fully preserved in the German translation where it simply uses \"CET1-Kapitalquote\", though this is not entirely incorrect as CET1 implies core capital.\n\nThe grammar and constructs in the German translation are correctly managed, with proper declension, punctuation where necessary, and syntax.\n\nTherefore, considering its output neatly encompasses nearly all of the original meaning and maintains grammatical accuracy, the score can be set at 80/100. This reflects a translation that captures most of the original document's intent and content with minor deviations from the added subtleties present in the human reference."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 212, "completion_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 581}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_7d35882d38"}}, "error": null}

Both translations accurately convey the essential informational elements of the original English text, including the non-GAAP nature of the financial measures discussed.

It accurately conveys the request to refer to a specific section for definitions and IFRS reconciliations. Key terms like \"Supplementary Information (Unaudited)\", \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", and the concept of reconciliations to IFRS measures are correctly translated and retained, ensuring that the semantic content is preserved. The use of \"nicht gepr\u00fcft\" and \"nicht gem\u00e4\u00df IFRS definierte\" closely matches the nuances in \"Unaudited\" and \"Non-GAAP\" from the source. Although the translation uses \"Abstimmungen\" instead of \"\u00dcberleitung\" (reconciliation), this choice does not significantly impact the overall meaning, and hence, the translation can be regarded as having most of the meaning preserved with slight variations in term choice. Therefore, a score of 88 is appropriate as it denotes that the translation has preserved most of the meaning and has minor differences in terminological preference but no significant grammatical or semantic issues."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 282, "completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 502}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_486730399b"}}, "error": null}
