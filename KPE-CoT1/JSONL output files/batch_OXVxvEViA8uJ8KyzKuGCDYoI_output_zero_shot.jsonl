However, a reasonable estimation involves subjectively evaluating if the German sentence is fluent and grammatically correct. \n- **Translation Feedback**: The German translation looks syntactically correct and coherent. The choice of words (\"ausgerichtet\", \"konsequent\", \"verlassen\") fits well in the context of business strategy discussions in German. Without a specific language model to compute perplexity, the sentence structure appears straightforward for a native German speaker without apparent grammatical errors, suggesting low perplexity.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Token-Level Similarity Between the Source and Translated Sentences\nToken-level similarity assesses how individual units of meaning correspond between the source and its translation.

The structural integrity of the sentence is maintained from English to German, which includes proper translation of organizational name changes and their respective responsibilities.\n  \nStep 3: Combine the results and classify the translation quality.\n- The translation correctly maintains the complex structure and specific institutional terminology, translating terms accurately and preserving the original meaning and context.\n- Given the correct lexical choices and the maintenance of the logical and grammatical structure, the translation is classified as a \u201cMost meaning preserved, minor issues\u201d. If detailed analysis reveals minor translational nuances or minimal lexical discrepancies, these would be the only reasons to avoid categorizing it as \"Perfect translation\".
